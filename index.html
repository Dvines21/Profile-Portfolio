                    <p>Hi, I'm Divine Boston, a 3rd-year IT student at the University of Antique, where I'm improving my skills in software development and web design. 
                        Throughout my academic journey, I've worked on some projects, including game modification, responsive websites, and management systems. 
                        These experiences helped me develop my problem-solving skills and creativity.
                        My goal is to enhance my knowledge and hands-on experience to contribute to meaningful projects.
                        Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on and to learn more about my journey in IT!
